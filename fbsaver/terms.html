            <p>The User must read this document carefully.</p>
            <p>The Owner offers Products through the App Store. Although the entire contractual relationship

              Users. In particular, certain provisions may only apply to Consumers or to those Users that

              affected clause. In the absence of any such mention, clauses apply to all Users.

          </div>
          <div class=mb-5>
            <h5 id=item-4>Content on FbBookmark</h5>
            <p>Unless where otherwise specified or clearly recognizable, all content available on FbBookmark is owned or
              provided by the Owner or its licensors.
            </p>
            <p>The Owner undertakes its utmost effort to ensure that the content provided on FbBookmark infringes no
              applicable legal provisions or third-party rights.
              However, it may not always be possible to achieve such a result.</p>
            <p>In such cases, without prejudice to any legal prerogatives of Users to enforce their rights,
              Users are kindly asked to preferably report related complaints using the contact details
              provided in this document.</p>
            <h6>Rights regarding content on FbBookmark - All rights reserved</h6>
            <p>The Owner holds and reserves all intellectual property rights for any such content.</p>
            <p>Users may not therefore use such content in any way that is not necessary or implicit in the
              proper use of the Service.</p>
            <p>In particular, but without limitation, Users may not copy, download, share (beyond the limits
              set forth below), modify, translate, transform, publish, transmit, sell, sublicense, edit,
              transfer/assign to third parties or create derivative works from the content available on
              FbBookmark, nor allow any third party to do so through the User or their
              device, even without the User's knowledge.</p>
            <p>Where explicitly stated on FbBookmark, the User may download, copy and/or
              share some content available through FbBookmark for its sole personal
              and non-commercial use and provided that the copyright attributions and all the other
              attributions requested by the Owner are correctly implemented.</p>
            <p>Any applicable statutory limitation or exception to copyright shall stay unaffected.</p>

            <h5 id=item-5>Access to external resources</h5>
            <p>Through FbBookmark Users may have access to external resources provided
              by third parties. Users acknowledge and accept that the Owner has no control over such
              resources and is therefore not responsible for their content and availability.</p>
            <p>Conditions applicable to any resources provided by third parties, including those applicable
              to any possible grant of rights in content, result from each such third parties’ terms and
              conditions or, in the absence of those, applicable statutory law.</p>
            <p>In particular, on FbBookmark Users may see advertisements provided by
              third parties. The Owner does not control or moderate the advertisements displayed via
              FbBookmark. If Users click on any such advertisement, they will be
              interacting with any third party responsible for that advertisement.</p>
            <p>The Owner is not responsible for any matters resulting from such interaction with third
              parties, such as anything resulting from visiting third-party websites or using third-party
              content.</p>

          </div>

              the Service, terminating contracts, reporting any misconduct performed through FbBookmark or the Service to

            <p>Limitation of liability</p>
            <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, condition, warranty,
              right or remedy which the User may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or
              any similar State and Territory legislation and which cannot be excluded, restricted or
              modified (non-excludable right). To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability to
              the User, including liability for a breach of a non-excludable right and liability which is
              not otherwise excluded under these Terms of Use, is limited, at the Owner’s sole discretion,
              to the re-performance of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services
              supplied again.</p>
            <h6>US Users</h6>
            <p>Disclaimer of Warranties</p>
            <p>FbBookmark is provided strictly on an “as is” and “as available” basis.
              Use of the Service is at Users’ own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
              the Owner expressly disclaims all conditions, representations, and warranties — whether
              express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, but not limited to, any implied
              warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of
              third-party rights. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by user from
              owner or through the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein.</p>
            <p>Without limiting the foregoing, the Owner, its subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, officers,
              directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees do not warrant that the
              content is accurate, reliable or correct; that the Service will meet Users’ requirements;
              that the Service will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or
              secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that the Service is free of viruses
              or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of
              the Service is downloaded at users own risk and users shall be solely responsible for any
              damage to Users’ computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from such
              download or Users’ use of the Service.</p>
            <p>The Owner does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or
              service advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked
              website or service, and the Owner shall not be a party to or in any way monitor any
              transaction between Users and third-party providers of products or services.</p>
            <p>The Service may become inaccessible or it may not function properly with Users’ web browser,
              mobile device, and/or operating system. The owner cannot be held liable for any perceived or
              actual damages arising from Service content, operation, or use of this Service.</p>
            <p>Federal law, some states, and other jurisdictions, do not allow the exclusion and limitations
              of certain implied warranties. The above exclusions may not apply to Users. This Agreement
              gives Users specific legal rights, and Users may also have other rights which vary from
              state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement shall not apply to the
              extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
            <p>Limitations of liability</p>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Owner, and its
              subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and
              employees be liable for</p>
            <ul>
              <li>any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages,
                including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other
                intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the
                Service; and</li>
              <li>any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized
                access or use of the Service or User account or the information contained therein;</li>
              <li>any errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content;</li>
              <li>personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from User access
                to or use of the Service;</li>
              <li>any unauthorized access to or use of the Owner’s secure servers and/or any and all
                personal information stored therein;</li>
              <li>any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service;</li>
              <li>any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through the
                Service;</li>
              <li>any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of
                the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through
                the Service; and/or</li>
              <li>the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any User or third party. In no event
                shall the Owner, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents,
                co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees be liable for any claims, proceedings,
                liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding the amount
                paid by User to the Owner hereunder in the preceding 12 months, or the period of
                duration of this agreement between the Owner and User, whichever is shorter.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This limitation of liability section shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in
              the applicable jurisdiction whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort,
              negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if company has been advised of the
              possibility of such damage.</p>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
              damages, therefore the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to User. The terms give
              User specific legal rights, and User may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction
              to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under the terms
              shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
            <h6>Indemnification</h6>
            <p>The User agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates,
              officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees harmless from
              and against any and all claims or demands, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs
              or debt, and expenses, including, but not limited to, legal fees and expenses, arising from
            </p>
            <ul>

                received by User;</li>

            </h5>
            <h6>No Waiver</h6>
            <p>The Owner’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a
              waiver of any such right or provision. No waiver shall be considered a further or continuing
              waiver of such term or any other term.</p>
            <h6>Service interruption</h6>
            <p>To ensure the best possible service level, the Owner reserves the right to interrupt the
              Service for maintenance, system updates or any other changes, informing the Users
              appropriately.</p>
            <p>Within the limits of law, the Owner may also decide to suspend or terminate the Service
              altogether. If the Service is terminated, the Owner will cooperate with Users to enable them
              to withdraw Personal Data or information in accordance with applicable law.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the Service might not be available due to reasons outside the Owner’s

              or all rights or obligations under these Terms, taking the User’s legitimate interests into
              account. Provisions regarding changes of these Terms will apply accordingly.</p>
            <p>Users may not assign or transfer their rights or obligations under these Terms in any way,
              without the written permission of the Owner.</p>
            <h6>Contacts</h6>
            <p>All communications relating to the use of FbBookmark must be sent using
              the contact information stated in this document.</p>
            <h6>Severability</h6>
            <p>Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or unenforceable under
              applicable law, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the
              validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
            <h6>EU Users</h6>
            <p>Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or unenforceable, the
              parties shall do their best to find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and
              enforceable provisions thereby substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.
              In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced
              by the applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.
            </p>
            <p>Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the impossibility to enforce a
              particular provision of these Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the
              severed provisions are essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties
              would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the provision would not be
              valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable
              hardship on any of the parties.</p>
            <h6>US Users</h6>
            <p>Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to
              the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its
              original intent. These Terms constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner
              with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all other communications, including
              but not limited to all prior agreements, between the parties with respect to such subject
              matter. These Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
            <h6>Governing law</h6>
            <p>These Terms are governed by the law of the place where the Owner is based, as disclosed in
              the relevant section of this document, without regard to conflict of laws principles.</p>
            <h6>Exception for European Consumers</h6>
            <p>However, regardless of the above, if the User qualifies as a European Consumer and has their
              habitual residence in a country where the law provides for a higher consumer protection
              standard, such higher standards shall prevail.</p>
            <h6>Venue of jurisdiction</h6>

              Terms lies with the courts of the place where the Owner is based, as displayed in the
              relevant section of this document.</p>
            <h6>Exception for European Consumers</h6>
